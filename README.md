# avinetworks.avicontroller-openshift-k8s

Using this module you are able to install the Avi Vantage Controlller, to your system. However, minimum requirements must be met.

> **Warning:**  
This Ansible role is not meant to be ran repeatedly on the host. It's meant for deployment only. Once deployed the configuration for Avi is managed by Avi.

## Requirements

A Cisco openshift_k8s Device

## Role Variables

### openshift_k8s Deployment Example

> **Note:**  
When running. `gather_facts` needs to be set to `false`, failure to do so will cause Ansible failure on first step.
